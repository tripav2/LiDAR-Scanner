# LiDAR-Scanner
# 360Â° Indoor Spatial Mapping System

This project is a low-cost embedded system designed for indoor 3D spatial scanning and visualization. Built using a VL53L1X Time-of-Flight sensor, stepper motor, and TM4C1294 microcontroller, the device collects distance measurements across a 360Â° field and transmits them via UART to a PC for real-time visualization using Python and Open3D.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- 360Â° scanning using a stepper motor with 11.25Â° resolution (32 total steps)
- Distance measurement using VL53L1X ToF sensor (up to 4 meters)
- UART communication with PC at 115200 baud
- Real-time 2D/3D point cloud rendering with Open3D in Python
- LED indicators for scan status and step feedback
- Push-button scan trigger with sensor reset logic via XSHUT

## ðŸ§° Hardware Used
- **Microcontroller:** TM4C1294 (TI MSP-EXP432E401Y LaunchPad)
- **Distance Sensor:** VL53L1X ToF (I2C interface)
- **Stepper Motor:** 28BYJ-48 + ULN2003 driver
- **Estimated Cost:** ~$65 CAD

## ðŸ’» Software Components
- **Microcontroller Code:** C (Keil / CCS), includes motor control, I2C read, UART output
- **PC Visualization Code:** Python + PySerial + Open3D

| Button        | PJ0                        |

##  How to Run

1. **Set Up Hardware**
   - Connect VL53L1X to I2C pins
   - Connect stepper motor via ULN2003 to GPIO
   - Connect TM4C1294 via USB

2. **Flash Microcontroller**
   - Load and run the C code (e.g., `main.c`) onto the TM4C1294 board.

3. **Start Scan**
   - Press onboard button (PJ0) to trigger a 360Â° scan.
   - LEDs indicate scan progress.

4. **Visualize**
   - Run `visualizer.py` in Python.
   - Scan data is parsed and displayed using Open3D.
   - Data is saved as `tof_radar.xyz`.

## ðŸ“¸ Output Example
The point cloud accurately captures indoor layouts such as hallways, identifying wall edges, doors, and open space.

## Applications
- Indoor navigation & mapping
- Accessibility scanning for public buildings
- Mobile robotics & SLAM prototypes

## Limitations
- Max range: ~4m; sensitive to surface reflectivity
- Sensor read time (~140ms) is the primary speed bottleneck
- Minor floating-point error due to trigonometric calculations
